# Our Next.js Demo Starter App

###### I have installed the shadcn and configured all the pages we need

This app is going to have a few pages:
- Home page
- Cart Page
- Search Page
- Product Details Page
- And Category Page which will show products under the category

I have created all this pages above even done the layout, and added the loading and 404 pages

So we will just go into the pages and start work straight

Let's make the design minimalist just white and black

Any ideas of layout should be communicated before being carried out

For shadcn i have added the button, table, pagination and card ui component That we will need

The Cart Context has also been created too expecially Headerr and Footer file
